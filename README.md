This page contains some interesting projects I've worked on.

- [Simulating Turing machines](https://research.ftlsid.com/Computation/Simulating+Turing+machines) ([source code](https://github.com/sidmani/turing))
Wrote a domain-specific language for simulating Turing machines step-by-step, and used it to design a [universal Turing machine](https://research.ftlsid.com/Computation/Designing+a+universal+Turing+machine). Intended to deepen my understanding of automata theory.

- [Quasar jet visualization](https://sidmani.github.io/nrao530/) ([source code](https://github.com/sidmani/nrao530))
Worked with a prof in the physics department at UCLA to build a simulator for helical jets emitted from black holes. The goal was to determine the parameters of a particular quasar known as NRAO-530, by matching the simulated results to radio astronomy data. A technical write-up of one phenomenon predicted by the simulator is available [here](https://github.com/sidmani/nrao530/blob/master/nrao530.pdf), and is a good sample of my technical writing.

- [Generative ML for 3D objects](https://github.com/sidmani/dfr)
I built a GAN in Pytorch that learned 3D shapes from 2D training data. In order to do this, I had to implement StyleGAN-2 and build a differentiable raycaster. More details about the raycaster are in the readme at the link.
